# CPU

The programme is free-to-use for all kinds of developers.
### What does the project do
***
It is a processor simulation.

### Why is the project useful
***
Although many virtual processors have already been made, realization of your own processor is an interesting and challenging task
that helps to realize how complicated the machine is and allows to notice some details that could not be seen without it.

### How can I help
***
I explicitly welcome any outside contributors. Use my mail: _ilichev.kv@phystech.edu_.
__A strong request__:
* Ask before making significant changes
* Do not break the codestyle
* Do not destroy previous functionality with additions

### Where to ask questions
***
Use the mail mentioned earlier.
