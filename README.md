# CPU

The programme is free-to-use for all kinds of developers.
### What does the project do
***
It is a simulation of processor.

### Why is the project useful
***
Although many virtual processors have already been made, realization of your own processor is an interesting and challenging task, so that's it.

### How can I help
***
I explicitly welcome any outside contributors. Use my mail: _ilichev.kv@phystech.edu_.
__A strong request__:
* Ask before making significant changes
* Do not break the codestyle
* Do not destruct previous functionality with additions

### Where to ask questions
***
Use the mail mentioned earlier.
